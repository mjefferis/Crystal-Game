# Crystal Game

## About

The app generates a target number and the user is to match that number by clicking crystals. Each crystal is given a random numerical value between 1 and 12. If the user goes over the target number, they lose, whereas they win if they match the number. The game automatically resets once it is over and a new numerical value is generated both for the target number and each crystal. The target number is a random variable between 19 and 120.
